                <h3>WHO WE ARE</h3>
                <p>The Luxury founder’s long experience in the hospitality sector, coupled with an aspiration to develop the Ethiopian coffee industry, has created a momentum for the establishment of the Hadero Coffee Company in 2018.

                        Coffee passes from generation to generation as humankind strives to flourish and excel. It has been the driver behind the best innovative ideas in history. For Hadero, it is a privilege to be part of that history, Ethiopia’s precious gift to the world.
                        
                        In more than one way, every community in Ethiopia consumes coffee and it has become an integral part of the daily life of the country. ‘Bunna tetu’ (have coffee!) is an invitation that embodies Ethiopian hospitality.
                        We will strive to keep on providing you, our customer, with premium and new coffee product offerings as we endeavour to broaden our coffee knowledge.</p>
