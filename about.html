                </h1>
                <p>Coffee company Lexury was established in January of 2018. A purpose-built roastery was designed and built, following a detailed assessment and research into the coffee business in Ethiopia and on the continent. Lexury is a subsidiary of Jupiter Hospitality Holdings (JHH). Jupiter Hospitality Holdings has had twelve years of experience in the hospitality and services sector.

                        Lexury is primarily engaged in coffee roasting and grinding and is developing a chain of retail outlets. At the roastery in Addis Ababa, a coffee museum/gallery has been curated in order to teach the public about the business of coffee in Ethiopia. In time, the Lexury brand will include a ‘3C’ product portfolio – coffee, cake, and chocolate. The journey for coffee and cake is well started and for chocolate, it is in progress with the construction of a processing plant in the planning.
                        
                        The company plans to leverage corporate social responsibility by sourcing coffee from the area and thereby helping to uplift the surrounding community. Lexury has opened its first in a chain of retail coffee shops at the Jupiter International Hotel, Cazanchise and a processing plant at Jackross, Addis Ababa has been launched. The 1,000 square meter site combines coffee roasting, grinding, and packaging, and acts as the Lexury headquarters. The concept underpinning the development at Jackross is a coffee innovation hub. To this end, a curated coffee gallery cum museum has been added. Lexury’s mission is to nurture a unique culture whose guiding principle is to focus on leveraging innovation and technology, creative design, quality assurance, learning, research, and development.</p>
